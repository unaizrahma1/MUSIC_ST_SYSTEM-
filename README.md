Music Studio Management System

The Music Studio Management System is a web-based application designed to manage and organize the operations of a music studio. The system helps administrators efficiently handle studio activities through a simple and user-friendly interface. It follows a client–server architecture, where the frontend and backend communicate using RESTful APIs.
The frontend is developed using React.js, while the backend is built with Node.js and Express.js. All application data is stored and managed using MongoDB, ensuring reliable and scalable data handling.
